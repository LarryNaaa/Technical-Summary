## Spring Framework

### Spring MVC
Spring MVC is an HTTP oriented Spring Framework that handles classes denoted as controllers. We can implement methods for different HTTP requests. It offers decoupled ways of solving web frameworks through a model view controller(MVC) design pattern. We can reuse code without repurposing it again.


### Spring Boot
Spring Boot helps us to inject our functionality into the progarm and it provides a preconfigured projects to add in as dependecies. We don't need to spend much time on project set up.
