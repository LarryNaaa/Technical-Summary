## AJAX

AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)is a group of inter-related technologies like HTML/XHTML, JavaScript, DOM, XML, CSS, XMLHttpRequest etc.

You can send and receive data asynchronously without reloading the web page using AJAX. 

AJAX allows sending only important information to the server. Only the valuable data from the client-side is routed to the server-side. It makes your application more interactive and faster.

### Advantages
1. Speed
Reduce the server traffic in both side's request and also reduce the time consuming on both side response.

2. Interaction
AJAX is much responsive, whole page data transfers at a time.

3. XMLHttpRequest
XMLHttpRequest object call as an asynchronous HTTP request to the Server for transferring data both sides. It is used for sending requests to the non-Ajax pages.

4. Asynchronous calls
AJAX make asynchronous calls to a web server. This means that client browsers avoid waiting for all data to arrive before starting the rendering.

5. Form Validation
This is one of the biggest advantages of AJAX. Forms are a common element in a web page. Validation should be instant and proper, which is provided by AJAX. 

6. Bandwidth Usage
AJAX helps to improve speed and performance. Fetching data from the database and storing data into the database is performed in the background without reloading page.

### Disadvantages
1. It increases design and development time.
2. Complex. 
3. Less security.
4. Search Engines cannot index AJAX pages.
5. Browsers which disabled JavaScript cannot use the application.
6. Another server cannot display information within the AJAX.
